What Marie Kondo does to physical space, Sanchit does to JavaScript code - meticulously understanding spaghetti or redundant code, tidying and refactoring it so that it becomes more modular and maintainable. Besides promoting clean code, Sanchit also excels at handling complex tasks. In one of our projects, Sanchit had taken up a critical complex task of a functionality that required understanding from both frontend and backend. Sanchit, being highly committed, made sure that the task was completed in time and the functionality was delivered to the customers keeping in mind quality and performance of the application. We have been together for roughly 3 years and it has been a good experience working with Sanchit. Wishing him the best for the future.",
